MiniZap: Automation Workflow Dashboard (UI Prototype)

This repository showcases the complete User Interface (UI) for a lightweight, self-hosted automation tool, which I've named MiniZap. Think of it as the dashboard you'd use to manage simple "If This, Then That" workflows, similar to tools like Zapier. 

Important Note: This is currently a pure frontend project. The code here is focused on the user interface, routing, and styling. The data you see (such as run counts and active/inactive status) is static placeholder data used for visual presentation. There is no backend logic, database connection, or functional API integration yet. The actual automation code will be built in a later phase.

The main purpose of this repository is to demonstrate the UI/UX for managing complex workflows with a clean, functional dashboard.
